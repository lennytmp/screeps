1. Continue building extensions as we progress through RCL.
1. Repair stuff with builders.
1. If unit has to die because it's too old - let them go to spawn and donate resources.
1. Plan building a tower at some nice location.
1. Implement tower logic.
1. Make Carriers fill up completely before starting to give away their energy
1. Consider making the *Manager return which creep-configurations it wants, and let the generic Manager spawn/kill based on that.
