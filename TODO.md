# TODO list

1. Make screeps move away from if they are blocking road.
1. Place extensions along the roads.
1. Put containers on mining positions.
1. Continue building extensions as we progress through RCL.
1. Consider not building extensions near miners (they are always empty and prevent
   us building better units).
1. Repair stuff with builders.
1. If unit has to die because it's too old - let them go to spawn and donate resources.
1. Optimise carrier's behaviour further, e.g. if there are full harvesters
   nearby - prioritise emptying them over doing something else.
   Note: might be useless after harvesers become static.
1. Plan building a tower at some nice location.
1. Implement tower logic.
