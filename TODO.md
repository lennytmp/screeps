# TODO list

1. If available energy in room is twice the price of harvester - don't revive it.
1. Replace harvester body generation function: one move, one carry, many many WORK.
1. Make carriers energy market aware.
1. Make screeps move away from if they are blocking road.
1. Continue building extensions as we progress through RCL.
1. Consider not building extensions near miners (they are always empty and prevent
   us building better units).
1. Repair roads with builders
